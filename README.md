# US House Prices Analysis
This project's intent is to showcase the capabilities of Pandas (Panel Data- multidimensional structured data sets)
for analyzing a time series dataset from house prices in throughout United States, segmented by geography down to the 
neighborhood granularity.

This analysis is useful to understand how the prices compare accross the country, as to analyze how these are changing
through time.

The dataset is Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI): A smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value and 
market changes across a given region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th 
percentile range. https://www.zillow.com/research/data/
